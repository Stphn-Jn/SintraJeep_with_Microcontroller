# SintraJeepney-Project

A comprehensive DIY engineering project focused on building a fully functional, scale-model Jeep from scratch. This project combines manual craftsmanship using **Sintraboard** (PVC Foam Board) with embedded systems and custom PCB design to create a vehicle that mimics real-world automotive mechanics.

## 🚀 Project Vision

The **SintraJeep** is more than just a toy; it is an exploration into vehicle dynamics, structural design, and electronics. By using Sintraboard as the primary material, the build remains lightweight and easy to modify, while the microcontroller integration allows for realistic control over steering, speed, and scale-model lighting.

## 🛠 Features

* **Scratch-Built Chassis:** Hand-cut and molded from Sintraboard sheets.
* **Proportional Steering:** A dedicated servo-motor system for precise front-wheel turning.
* **Custom PCB Design:** Professional circuit integration designed in KiCad.
* **Smart Lighting:** Logic-controlled LEDs for headlights, tail lights, and signals.
* **CAD Guided:** Built using precise 2D layouts and DWG sketches for accuracy.
